# Arduino_Tomoto_HM330X

## What is this?

This is an Arduino library for HM3301/HM3302 dust sensor like this: https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Laser-PM2-5-Sensor-HM3301.html

This library is much simpler to use than the one originally published by Seeed.

## How to use this?

See `examples/BasicHM330XDemo`, which explains pretty much everything.

If you have M5StickC or M5Atom Matrix, please try `examples/M5Stack/AirQualityMeter`. Click the image below to watch the video.
